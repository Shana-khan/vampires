    <h1>Energy, Psychic, and Blood Vampirism: A Parapsychological Reading</h1>

    <p>Throughout history, the most contrasting human figures—from the greatest saints to the most abject criminals—have sometimes been described, symbolically or literally, as vampires. This label does not necessarily refer to the popular myth of the nocturnal blood-drinker, but to a more subtle reality: that of beings capable of feeding on invisible forces—emotional, psychic, or vital. Some would feed on so-called positive energies—stemming from faith, devotion, love, or admiration—while others would absorb negative energies generated by fear, suffering, hatred, or despair.</p>

    <p>From this parapsychological perspective, certain extreme criminals appear as energy predators. Serial killers, torturers, and those guilty of sadistic violence in particularly dark historical contexts—such as the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps or the experiments of Unit 731—did not merely destroy their victims physically. They also seemed to feed on the psychic and emotional distress they caused, as if human suffering constituted a source of stimulation for them, or even inner sustenance.</p>

    <p>On the opposite end, certain major spiritual figures have also been perceived as vampires of another kind. Their profound influence on crowds, their ability to soothe, heal, transform beings, but also to absorb the projections, hopes, and torments of those who approached them, suggest another form of energy exchange. These individuals, often ascetic and deeply disciplined, seemed capable of transmuting the energies received, elevating them rather than consuming them.</p>

    <p>Thus, vampirism, viewed from this angle, would be neither inherently good nor evil. It would primarily constitute a particular mode of relating to the world and others, based on the exchange—or extraction—of energy. Everything would then depend on the nature of this <a href="scarlet-breath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">energy</a>, the awareness of the one manipulating it, and the intention guiding their actions. It is in this murky zone, between spirituality, psychopathology, and esotericism, that the notion of energy, psychic, and blood vampirism is situated.</p>

    <h2>Vampirism and Spiritual Discernment</h2>

    <p>As a parapsychology researcher for seventeen years now, and a direct witness to numerous unexplained phenomena, I am convinced that there exist individuals endowed with abilities far exceeding our current understanding of reality. This conviction is based neither on religious belief nor on ideological adherence to a spiritual current, but on an accumulation of concrete observations, rigorously documented, sometimes disturbing in their very coherence.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my career, I have personally participated in more than a hundred experiments, conducted both in laboratories and under controlled natural conditions. This work has confronted me with truly astonishing manifestations: high-success-rate telepathy between twins in double-blind protocols, statistically significant precognition over hundreds of trials—notably in ganzfeld and on quantum generators—influences of measurable psychokinesis on random number generators certified by Princeton University's PEAR program and replicated by the Institute of Noetic Sciences. I have also witnessed out-of-body experiences confirmed by the correct reading of hidden targets in sealed rooms, or by precise descriptions of events occurring hundreds of kilometers away, as well as apparitions of entities perceived simultaneously by several sober witnesses with no psychiatric history. Added to this are cases of reincarnation accompanied by birthmarks corresponding to fatal injuries, verified by cross-referencing with civil registries on other continents.</p>

    <p>These observations were made, as far as possible, within strict methodological frameworks: infrared cameras, independent witnesses, continuous recordings, in-depth statistical analyses, protocols validated by ethics committees. They have led me to recognize that human beings can, in rare circumstances, manifest abilities that exceed the currently accepted materialist framework. These phenomena remain fragile, unstable, difficult to reproduce at will, and often incompatible with known physical models, yet they withstand honest critical examination.</p>

    <p>Having stated this with the utmost firmness, it would be intellectually dishonest to conceal the other side of this reality. Anyone who has even dipped a toe into the worlds of the paranormal, spirituality, or occultism knows that the overwhelming majority—at least 95%—of what is presented there today is illusion, staging, or outright fraud. The field is infested with charlatans whose motivations almost always boil down to the same triad: sex, power, and money. The contemporary vampiric subculture, whether it claims to be blood-based or psychic, is no exception to this drift and even constitutes one of its most toxic, pathological, and crime-prone terrains.</p>

    <p>However, dismissing outright any possibility of real vampirism on the pretext of this proliferation of false prophets would be a symmetrical error. The phenomena exist, though rare, and true vampires have little in common with New Age imagery or caricatures from Anglo-Saxon popular culture. Those I have personally encountered live in Europe, lead outwardly ordinary lives—they work, do their shopping, sometimes have a family—and differ from ordinary people only by certain profound peculiarities, both psychic, energetic, and behavioral.</p>

    <p>True vampires do not expose themselves. They claim nothing, seek neither recognition nor fascination. They keep their abilities silent, sometimes even deny them, preferring shadow to light, silence to noise, discretion to any form of staging. This invisibility is not a pose but a necessity. It constitutes both protection and an implicit rule of survival.</p>

    <p>There is no single vampirism, but a plurality of forms. Some vampires feed on blood, others on vital, psychic, sexual, or astral energy; still others are hybrids. Some are born with these predispositions, others develop them during childhood or adolescence, sometimes following trauma, sometimes without identifiable cause. One constant remains, however: when they encounter one another, they recognize each other instantly, as if an invisible signature made them mutually perceptible.</p>

    <p>This marginal but persistent reality demands a lucid approach, stripped of both romanticism and dogmatic skepticism. It requires discernment, rigor, and humility—qualities too often absent from contemporary discourses on the paranormal, yet indispensable for any authentic understanding of the vampiric phenomenon.</p>

    <h2>Spiritual Figures and Energy Vampirism</h2>

    <p>Jesus himself could be considered an emblematic example of positive energy vampirism. Several biblical episodes take on a particular dimension when interpreted from this angle. During the Last Supper, when he declares: “Eat, this is my body; drink, this is my blood,” the bread and wine would not be understood literally but as symbols of a circulation of vital energy. This interpretation suggests that Jesus shared his energy with his disciples, offering each a portion of vitality and higher consciousness through a codified ritual.</p>

    <p>Another passage illustrates this ability more concretely: when a woman suffering from hemorrhages touches his cloak, Jesus immediately feels a loss of energy and asks: “Who touched me?” The woman is then healed. This gesture can be read as an energy exchange: the woman takes energy, and Jesus, aware of this interaction, regulates it, creating a beneficial balance for her.</p>

    <p>The positive energy vampire operates on the same principle: he returns to others the energy sent to him, amplified or modulated according to the intentions and feelings of those approaching him. His presence thus becomes a subtle mirror: it can bring good or bad luck, healing or imbalance, depending on the attitude and emotional state of the people around him.</p>

    <p>Saints and good energy vampires share a profound understanding of this dynamic. They know that kindness, empathy, and self-mastery are the safest path to inner balance, both for themselves and for those around them. However, unlike the saint, whose patience may seem infinite, the good energy vampire has clear limits. He tolerates injustice, malice, or ignorance for a time, but when his tolerance thresholds are reached, he allows what some call his “inner dragon” to emerge: a concentrated destructive force capable of restoring balance through energy that could be described as lightning-like, and which, in its most extreme manifestations, can sow death and desolation among those who have abused his patience or trust.</p>

    <p>Thus, the positive energy vampire is defined not only by his ability to receive or redistribute energy, but also by his wisdom in using this power: he is both healer and regulator, capable of infinite kindness but also of formidable power when it comes to defending the cosmic and moral balance around him.</p>

    <p>Positive energy vampires are not limited to a simple transfer of energy. Their existence is governed by a strict, almost ascetic code that determines both their interactions with others and their way of living in the world. Most lead solitary or semi-solitary lives, cultivating calm, discretion, and self-mastery. Their social network is deliberately limited, for they never draw energy from vulnerable people: children, adolescents, the sick, or the elderly are always protected from their influence. They draw energy only from healthy individuals in body and mind, often consenting ones, sharing with them a commitment to a balanced and sober life.</p>

    <p>This practice is not a mere act of survival or pleasure: it is always accompanied by an ethical and symbolic dimension. The positive energy vampire recognizes that energy exchange is an implicit pact, a subtle ritual where trust and respect are essential. Those who agree to participate in this exchange become, in a sense, partners in the circulation of vital energy. They receive not only extra energy but also a transmission of knowledge and consciousness, an initiatory journey toward a better understanding of self and the world.</p>

    <p>Their power is not only internal: it manifests in their ability to regulate negative energies. In occultism, one speaks of an “energy shield” or “psychic barrier” that protects against attacks, malice, and hostile intentions. But this shield is not limited to protection: it reflects negative energies with an intensity proportional to the intention and severity of the attacks. Thus, the good energy vampire acts as an amplifier of cosmic justice: malice toward him or those he protects always rebounds on the aggressor, sometimes spectacularly.</p>

    <p>For energy vampires, kindness is not naivety but mastery: it coexists with constant vigilance and, when necessary, with a powerful and just capacity for reaction. The “fury” they may allow to emerge is never gratuitous: it always responds to a profound imbalance and aims to restore harmony. Their life is thus a subtle balance between compassion and power, generosity and protection, calm and intensity.</p>

    <p>Finally, it must be emphasized that energy vampires, far from being mythical or fantastic figures, embody a philosophy of life: they remind us that self-mastery, ethics in the use of power, and understanding of invisible energy flows can transform the relationship between the individual and the world. Their discreet and often unknown existence illustrates a profound truth: energy, whether physical, mental, or spiritual, is a living link that governs our interactions, and those who know how to perceive and channel it hold a form of wisdom that only time can reveal.</p>

    <h2>Blood and Psychic Vampires: Destructive Forces</h2>

    <p>In contrast to positive energy vampires, certain categories of vampires embody darker and potentially destructive forces. Blood vampires literally feed on blood and are almost always associated with behavioral and mental disorders. Hyperactive, narcissistic, angry, and sometimes psychopathic, these individuals live in excess and the pursuit of immediate gratification. Their blood appetite is often coupled with sexual urges, alcohol or drug consumption, and a propensity for violence. Their influence on those around them is almost always negative, and their intense but short lives are characterized by permanent chaos.</p>

    <p>Psychic vampires feed on mental and emotional energy. Their impact on others can be subtle and insidious: they manipulate emotions, amplify anxieties, or psychically exhaust those around them without direct physical intervention. Some do not master their power and act unconsciously, draining those around them, while others have worked to develop it and can exert considerable influence, positive or negative depending on their nature.</p>

    <p>There are also hybrids, combining several forms of vampirism—blood, psychic, and energy. These individuals possess immense but dangerous potential, as their balance is fragile and their greed can drive them to devastating excesses. They perfectly illustrate the principle that power without mastery almost always leads to destruction.</p>

    <p>The contrast with good energy vampires is striking. Where the latter cultivate discipline, empathy, and respect for natural balances, blood and psychic vampires live in excess, manipulation, and the pursuit of immediate gratification. The coexistence of these types of vampires in the human world highlights a universal dynamic: power, whether energetic, psychic, or material, requires mastery and ethics to avoid becoming destructive.</p>

    <p>Thus, the complete typology of vampirism—energy, psychic, and blood—does not reduce to a simple classification. It reveals profound truths about human nature: extraordinary faculties, whether conscious or not, can be sources of healing and wisdom, or on the contrary of chaos and suffering, depending on the intention, discipline, and morality of those who possess them.</p>

    <h2>Consciousness, Mastery, and Energy Karma</h2>

    <p>Not all energy or psychic vampires are necessarily dangerous or malicious. Some people—hyperactive, depressive, schizophrenic, or bipolar—possess these faculties involuntarily and unconsciously. Unable to master them, they can drain those around them without realizing it. Others, however, have acquired these abilities voluntarily, after years of discipline, training, and inner work.</p>

    <p>When a positive energy vampire fully masters his power, he becomes a true vector of luck and well-being for those he loves. He does everything possible for their happiness and balance. Conversely, any aggressive or ill-intentioned person toward him exposes themselves to powerful energy rebounds. The vampire then protects himself with an energy bubble, a psychic shield that strengthens his resistance and reflects attacks back to their source. The more violent the aggression, the stronger the shield becomes, creating a mechanism of protection and karmic justice.</p>

    <p>This dynamic is described in occultism by the law of the boomerang effect: any thought or action directed toward another returns to its emitter with amplified intensity. Insulting, slandering, or wishing harm to a positive energy vampire can thus lead to serious consequences, sometimes even for the aggressor's entourage, while the vampire remains unharmed. Pure people and saints often have this same type of protection, sometimes unconsciously. The good vampire, however, distinguishes himself by the extent of his work and commitment: years of deprivation, mental and physical trials forge a shield so powerful that the energy rebound can, in extreme cases, be fatal to the aggressor.</p>

    <p>At the end of life, some energy vampires prolong their existence through a transfer of consciousness, reminiscent of ancient esoteric practices such as the Tibetan phowa or ’jug. This technique, from the Six Yogas of Naropa and described in the Hevajra Tantra, allows an initiated master to transfer his consciousness into another body—sometimes a cadaver or an animal—in order to continue his work and teachings. Mythical figures like Marpa Lotsawa are said to have used it to demonstrate their powers and perform miracles.</p>

    <p>Thus, the life and actions of positive energy vampires are not merely about consuming energy. They embody a true philosophy: consciousness, discipline, ethics, and respect for natural balances. Their existence illustrates the profound link between power, mastery, and responsibility, and reminds us that energy, whether physical, psychic, or spiritual, is a vector of life whose use, just or unjust, has tangible consequences on the world and on others.</p>
